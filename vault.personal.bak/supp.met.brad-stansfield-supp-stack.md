## Supplements I’ll Add In As I Age

### Age 45: NAC 1 gram

Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant, and a critical regulator of oxidative stress and immune function.

There is data to “suggest that there is a continuous, linear increase in oxidative events throughout adult life but that the capacity of the Glutathione antioxidant system is maintained until 45 years and then declines rapidly.” ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12398937 )

We have evidence from a human, placebo-controlled study that supplementing with the Glutathione precursors, Glycine & NAC, corrects the Glutathione deficiency in older adults and improved hand grip strength ( https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/glac135/6668639 )

Collagen supplements already have significant quantities of Glycine, plus I already take Trimethylglycine (TMG), so I’m already getting all the glycine that I likely need. Therefore, when I reach 45 years of age, I’ll only add NAC to my supplement stack.

## Supplements/Medications I’m Excited About & Awaiting More Data

### Rapamycin

Over and over again when the Interventions Testing Program trials Rapamycin in genetically diverse mice, it extends both male and female lifespan.

Because of its mechanism of action, I’ve chose to set up a clinical trial combining regular exercise with either Rapamycin or Placebo to see if Rapamycin improves muscle performance.

While I’m very excited about Rapamycin’s potential, I don’t think it should be used outside of clinical trials to assess that it’s both safe and effective

### 17-Alpha Estradiol

This is a “non-feminizing” type of estrogen that the Interventions Testing Program demonstrated a lifespan extension in males. There’s also data showing an improvement in muscle strength.

Similar to Rapamycin, I’m very excited about this molecule, however I don’t think that it should be used outside of clinical trials to assess both safety and efficacy.

### Finasteride (for males only)

Finasteride is a molecule that blocks the conversion of Testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone, and is used in clinical medicine to reduce male pattern baldness and shrink the size of the prostate.

There’s interesting observational data suggesting that males who take Finasteride have lower rates of prostate cancer, and I’m eagerly awaiting more data on this to be published. I wonder if most males will eventually use this to reduce prostate cancer rates?
Supplements I Used To Take But Have Now Stopped

### NMN/NR:

There’s interesting mice and single cell studies regarding NAD+ precursors, however the human data demonstrating a benefit is lacking. I focus on stopping my NAD from declining by using a small dose of Niacin, regular exercise, a great diet, periods of safe fasting, and restful sleep. 

Furthermore we don’t know the long-term effects of boosting NAD+ to very high levels.

### Resveratrol/Pterostilbene:

The research around using molecules to activate sirtuin-1 is very conflicting. We may not need to further activate sirtuin-1 if we already exercise, sleep well, and have a great diet. 

Furthermore, it’s unlikely that resveratrol/pterostilbene directly activates sirtuin-1 anyway. There was a paper published in 2020 that used CRISPR technology that explored how resveratrol/pterostilbene work and the authors found the following:

“The ability of resveratrol to inhibit cell proliferation and S phase transit was independent of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1, which has been implicated in lifespan extension by resveratrol. These results establish that a primary impact of resveratrol on human cell proliferation is the induction of low-level replicative stress.”  (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32755594/)

Until there’s more compelling research, I’ve stopped taking both of these molecules.
### Metformin/Berberine:

Metformin is a medication that I prescribe to my Type 2 Diabetic patients, and the initial data suggested that it could extend lifespan of non-diabetic patient as well.

However, when the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) trialed metformin in 2016, there was no lifespan benefit: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5013015/)

Towards the end of 2021 a randomized, placebo-controlled, human trial that ran for 21 years was published. This trial took people at high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, and tested whether metformin would improve death rates, heart disease, and cancer when compared with placebo. Unfortunately, there was no benefit seen: https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/12/2775/138471/Effect-of-Metformin-and-Lifestyle-Interventions-on

Furthermore, there’s good data showing that metformin blunts the positive exercise effects: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351883/

This data has convinced me to stop taking metformin altogether. Crucial to note though that for pre-diabetics and Type 2 diabetics, metformin is a wonderful medication.

### Quercetin/Fisetin:

The Interventions Testing Program trialed Fisetin, and unfortunately there was no healthspan, lifespan, or senolytic activity seen. Therefore in my opinion, the preclinical work does not support the use of Quercetin or Fisetin supplements.

There are a number of human studies ongoing, and until we have robust, published data showing a benefit, I’ve stopped taking both Quercetin & Fisetin. See this video here: https://youtu.be/Q3SX9B0QNWY 

### Ashwagandha:

There is some human evidence to suggest that Ashwagandha can improve anxiety levels. Personally I didn’t notice a difference, and I made the decision to stop Ashwagandha to reduce my ‘pill-burden’. This is more of a personal, rather than evidence-based choice. 

### Sulforaphane:

Sulforaphane is a potent activator of an enzyme called NRF2, the ‘master’ antioxidant switch. There are promising cell and mice studies, but at this stage the human data is lacking. Until this molecule is proven in humans, I’ve elected to simplify my supplement stack and stop sulforaphane. To support my anti-oxidant levels as I get older, I plan on taking Glycine & NAC from the age of 45.

### Apigenin:

Apigenin is an inhibitor of an enzyme called CD38, and CD38 might be a reason why in some tissues, NAD+ levels go down as we age. There are exciting cell and mice studies that have used Apigenin, but much like Sulforaphane there is a lack of human data. To simplify my supplement stack, I’ve elected to stop Apigenin until more human studies are completed that prove a benefit
